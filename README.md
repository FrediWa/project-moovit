# project-moovit
This repo contains the source code of Muuvit, an application created as part of the Project Course, a 15ECTS course where technology and business students come together to plan a hypotethical or real business and creating the corresponding product or service.

My role in this project was lead developer and architect. I designed the system, suggested technologies, tracked work and made sure the most important requirements were met. The application is far from finished but I want to showcase this as it's, despite unfinished, my biggest and realest project to date. 

## Muuvit
Muuvit exists as a solution to the lack of excercise in Finland. The idea is to have one platform for finding and hosting exercise events. Normally one would use Facebook or such to advertise their exercise group and find people. Muuvit's idea is to provide a better platform for this kind of socialized exercise. 

## Technical solution
3-layer monolihic MERN stack web app designed for mobile screens.
