### Event browsing

`GET /events`
| Parameters   | Description                            |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| tags         | an array of tags (given as strings)    |
| start_time   | ISO 8601 containing date and time      |
| end_time     | ISO 8601 containing date and time      |
| geolocation  | Tuple of long/lat coordinates          |
| max_distance | Maximum accepted distance from given geolocation to possible events        |

#### Date & Time
If time is given but not date, today is assumed. If date is given but no time, 00:00 is given to start date, 23:59 is given to end date.

Time is stored in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). We'll figure out later how the the correct time can be displayed without the users input.

##### Example
User gives date range 1 August 2022 - 3 August 2022. Resulting start time will be `2022-08-01T00:00:00+0000` and the end time will be `2022-08-03T23:59:00+0000`.

User gives only the start time 12:37 (the date is 18 October 2023). The resulting start time will be `2023-10-18T12:37:00+000`. The end time will be assumed to be midnight the same day, i.e. `2023-10-18T23:59:00+000`. If no start time is given, the date is the current date and the time is 00:00.

#### Geolocation
Events locations are defines as a GeoJSON Point. User can enter a coordinate (another GeoJSON Point) to find events near the entered Point.

This is what a GeoJSON Point looks like `{ type: "Point", coordinates: [ 40, 5 ] }`.

`GET /event/:id`

ðŸ”’ Requires authentication and authorization.

#### Returns
Information about the given event as JSON

Gets information about specific event

| date         | ISO 6801 date with time                |
| location     | GeoJSON point with coordinates         |
| host         | Host full name                         |

PUT event/:id uses the same properties as POST. 

ðŸ”’ Requires authentication and authorization.

## GDPR compliance
For now we will assume it is not

## Development
run with `nodemon run dev`
### ENV
The ENV variables needed are put in a `.env` file in the system root. The following variables are needed:
- DB_URI=\<value\>
- JWT_SECRET=\<value\>
  
The values can be found in the code folder in the project OneDrive. 

### Architecture
The application is monolithic multi-layered. It consists of a router that handles HTTP requests and a set of modules that handle business logic.
### Routing layer
### Service layer
### Data access layer
#### Images
Images are uploaded to system/images/. Cloudinary could be used as an alternative.

An uploaded file is named "\<event_creator\>+\<event_name\>" hashed with bcrypt, the original file extension is kept. The file URI is added to the database.
#### Blurhash
Blurhash is calculated whenever image is changed. Blurhash is added to the database.
### Facade patterns
Each module exposes a set of functions (facade). Only facade functions should be used. New ones may be created but should be well documented.
### MongoDB schemas
#### User profile
#### Event
| Name      | Description           | Type                  |
|-----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| eventName |                       | string
| startTime |                       | string (ISODate/ISO6801)
| endTime   |                       | string (ISODate/ISO6801)
| location  |                       | GeoJSON 
| imageURI  |                       | string
| blurhash  |                       | string

### Deployment
We'll worry about it later.

### Testing
We will be using Jest for unit testing and JMeter for executing performance testing as part of our testing procedures.
